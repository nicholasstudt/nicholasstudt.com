Version 1.3.1 of the blog is now available for [download](http://code.nicholasstudt.com/wiki/DjangoBlog).

This release fixes several problems that multi-site enabled blogs were
facing and problems with the tag feed displaying the wrong content. A
new template was added for the display of listing entries by tag, along
with a new setting to specify the pagination size of the tag list.
