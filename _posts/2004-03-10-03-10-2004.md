This morning [Slashdot broke the
news](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/10/1540234&mode=thread)
that Intel has a driver out for their Centrino wireless cards. Having
spent a bit of time reading this over it looks good, it just needs a bit
of fleshing out. The initial version doesn't support WEP, which makes
this useless for me at the moment. However, I do plan on keeping a close
eye on this.
