![Ghetto Zoo:: Nikon D70 : 1/60s : f/4.5 : ISO 200](/media/2004/06/ghetto-zoo.jpg)

Found this little guy at the Ghetto Zoo this past Friday. Let me
explain&mdash;Karen and I had the opportunity to go to the zoo in Kansas
City for free. I figured I'd be able to get a couple of decent animal
photos.

On the drive out, I made mention of this particular zoo's colloquial
name&mdash;the Ghetto Zoo. Contrary to popular belief, this nickname is
not based on its placement in the city, but rather the zoo's rather
rundown and shabby feel. Yes, I do know that this nickname isn't the
nicest, and probably shouldn't be mentioned in polite company. Needless
to say, I didn't give the zoo its nickname.

Karen thought I was being unusually critical of the zoo until we got
back around to the performing seals. There were seven seals; of these,
three or four were blind, another couple were deaf, and I believe
there may have been one healthy one in the bunch.

We didn't stay much past that point.
