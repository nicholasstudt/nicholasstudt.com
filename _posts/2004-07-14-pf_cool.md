I'm late for this week's [Photo Friday](http://www.photofriday.com) ,
but the heat here makes me sluggish. It seems that every year I forget
how miserable humidity makes the heat feel. Cool is hard to do when your
skin is melting.

By the way, I now have comments. You should leave one if you are bored.
