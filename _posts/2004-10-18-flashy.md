![Flashy :: Nikon D70 : 5s : f/22 : ISO 200](/media/2004/10/flashy.jpg)

The idea of flashy sure has changed a bit since 1904 when the coffee
shop I frequent was built. Nestled in the middle of the building is this
large stained glass ceiling. I think I like the old idea of flashy
versus the newer ideas.

I'm submitting this to [lensday.com](http://www.lensday.com) for the
"flashy" contest.
