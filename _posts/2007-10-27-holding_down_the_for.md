![Holding Down :: Nikon D70](/media/2007/10/down.jpg)

If you haven't noticed--and I assume you have if you are here--the old
site is being torn down to make way for the new site. This should give
me a chance to do a bit of house cleaning, as well as refocus a bit. So
the angrydwarf is dead; long live the photodwarf. All of the old content
is still here and can be found by looking in the archive. 

I received a [Knit Picks](http://knitpicks.com) Options needle set in
the mail this past Wednesday. The needles feel like an interchangeable
set of Addi Turbos (insert light saber sound here).  As amazing as these
needles are, the case that comes with them is a resounding
disappointment. I also ordered the new clear bag case that comes with
the Options Harmony set, and that one is not much better, although it's
at least passable. So, I've decided to construct myself needle cases
that don't suck. We'll have to see how that goes.
