![Clouds :: Nikon D70 : 1/160s : f/18 : ISO 200](/media/2004/06/clouds.jpg)

The past month has brought several amazing storms through the area, most
of which happened during the middle of the night. A few of these storms
brought with them clouds that begged to be photographed. I, of course,
didn't happen to have my camera with me at the time. Alas, Fates, you
are cruel to me. This photo is from the end of May, right after I
returned from New York.

Entered in the [PhotoFriday](http://www.photofriday.com) clouds challenge.

**P.S.** The statue is holding a shovel, not relieving itself.
