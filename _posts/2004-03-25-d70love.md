![Bad Self-portrait](/media/2004/03/nikon.jpg)

Today, at long last, my new camera arrived: a [Nikon
D70](http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&amp;grp=2&amp;productNr=25214).
To anyone who has not spent the last three months reading technical
specifications, reviews, and press releases, this is the famed "Rebel
Killer."

I don't know if this is premature, but the hype may just be true. I
strongly doubt, however, that Paul Simon will have a song about digital
cameras anytime soon. The only real concern I have about the camera is
that Karen may hide it, since I have taken somewhere around 200 "test
shots" of her this evening.

Who knew that a manual could be so exciting to read...
