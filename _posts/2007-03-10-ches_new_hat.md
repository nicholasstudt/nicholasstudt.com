Well, it's not actually for Che &mdash; it's for the munchkin one of
Karen's friends recently had.  [The
pattern](http://www.helloyarn.com/topdownbonnet.htm) originally called
for little ears and a face, but we thought that might look a bit odd
with this yarn.

*Update:* Here is [another
one](http://rumposinc.blogspot.com/2007/04/every-baby-is-two-babies.html)
of these hats that was sent out to some of Karen's other friends.
