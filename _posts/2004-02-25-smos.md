![Six months of Solitude](/media/2004/02/sixmonthsofsolitude-org.jpg)

[Six months of Solitude](http://karenvaughn.info) is a blog populated by
strange movie reviews, bizarre political take offs, and other random
ponderings by my wife, Karen. For the curious the photo banner is a
touched up photo of dead buses formerly used by the University of
Kansas. Don't mind the late model Chrysler behind the tree. (Karen
swears that the domain has nothing to due with the duration of our
marriage when the domain was registered. The jury is still out on this.)
	
This design was created in January of 2004, the use of blue shadings was
intended to help drive home the idea of solitude intended in the title.
