![Hands :: Nikon D70](/media/2007/11/hands.jpg)

Finished some more wrist warmers to match Karen's new cape. Aside from
that, the past couple weeks have been a bit hectic. Karen's friends
came into town for a couple days, I had two big projects due, and just
for fun, Karen got sick for Thanksgiving.

The last couple of days have slowed down a bit while nursing Karen back
to health. Between runs to the store for comfort food and medicine, I
finished another devil baby hat, the first sock in a pair, and made a
bit of progress on an adult-sized hat.
