*Note:* The following could be considered highly cynical.

I don't have a very good view of politicians in general. I've always
felt they rate just above soap scum and below toe fungus. Not even party
affiliation affects this classification. I used to be able to chalk this
up to a disaffected youth outlook, but that doesn't seem to pass muster
now that I am married. Something about that car insurance discount
changes the allowed reasons for not liking politicians.

With about the same excitement that I reserve for concerts, I went with
Karen to wait for the Kerry/Edwards train to come through our little
burg. At the end the train didn't stop, though there was a very
surprised group of passengers when a regularly scheduled train stopped.
In fact, I would venture to say they got an even bigger response just
because they stopped. With the regular train in the station, I snapped
this picture of a campaign balloon. I can't say I like the politicians
any more than I did before, but you have to admire them for coming back
to a state that they are doomed to lose in the upcoming election.
