Tonight we took Zooey downtown for her second trick-or-treat event. We
even remembered to get down there earlier so there was still candy.

At each shop she approached the staff and very quietly said, "Trick or
treat." She even remembered to say thank you to everyone who gave her
candy. No stopping at two suckers this year.
