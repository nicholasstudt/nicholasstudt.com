I'll sea your ocean and raise you a red flower. Yes, I did just make
that pun. This week's PhotoFriday contest was 'ocean'. For those of you
paying attention, you may recall that I am in the middle of Kansas.
Where am I going to find an ocean? So instead, I present this red flower
from the front of the coffee shop I frequent.
