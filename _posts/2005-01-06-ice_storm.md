![Ice :: Nikon D70 : 1/1250s : f/7.1 : ISO 200](/media/2005/01/ice.jpg)

Ice has covered almost everything in Lawrence. This morning the sun even
made a brief appearance to illuminate the scene. I wouldn't mind the
ice so much if it was not accompanied by chilling winds and such a low
temperature. Oh well, winter in Kansas has finally arrived.

(There were no key parties in the neighborhood for the event.)
