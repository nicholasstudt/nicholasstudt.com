I've switched how I deal with this site again, hopefully simplifying for the
better. Rather than using my simple Django based blog, file-manager and template expander I've moved the whole thing to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). In theory this would allow me to host the site on [github](http://pages.github.com/). 

Zooey has been creating an unbelievable amount of paintings, drawings,
and sculptures at preschool. The picture above is one of these
masterpieces. Several weeks ago, we took pictures of each piece so we
could save the ones we liked and delight the city sanitation staff with
the rest.
