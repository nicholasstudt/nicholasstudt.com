We have a nice new arts center building here in Lawrence. This sculpture
is located right in front of the new building with all of its steel and
glass. I imagine this should make a good submission for this week's
[Photofriday](http://www.photofriday.com). Just so you know, the clouds
in the middle are a reflection.
