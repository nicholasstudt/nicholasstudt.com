![Simplicity :: Nikon D70 : 1/500s : f/4.5 : ISO 200](/media/2004/09/simplicity.jpg)

I took this photo during one of my morning walking expeditions around
the neighborhood this past July. I went back by this weekend to see if
the the rusted lock and chain were still hanging there, unfortunately it
wasn't.
