So, this is how it all starts again. There have been several false
starts over the last five years to actually get this domain doing
something useful, alas none has really kept my focus for long. Of course
all have been amusing at the time, I can't count the number of people
who have been fascinated by reloading a page with random content. So
hopefully this time will be different.
	
Let the festivities begin.

As a side note the content that used to drive the frontpage has been
completely removed from the server. I did not have the time to track
down who actually owns the jokes, so it is probably best that they are
no longer here.
