![Moving Day :: Nikon D70 : 1/80s : f/6.3 : ISO 200](/media/2004/08/moveday.jpg)

All of August is moving day in Lawrence. The students start to return
for the fall semester at the University of Kansas. During this time one
can find just about anything sitting out for the taking. Need a file
cabinet&#8212;here you go. Need a new bed&#8212;just a block further.
Need a new television&#8212;check the side streets.

There is a down side to all of this free stuff, the students in all of
their terrible glory are back.
