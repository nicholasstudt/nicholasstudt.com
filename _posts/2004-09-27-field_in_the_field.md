![Field :: Nikon D70 : 1/50s : f/29 : ISO 200](/media/2004/09/field.jpg)

I decided to carry my camera around with me today, just in case I saw
anything interesting. While on campus, over lunch, I had the chance to
take a couple of quick photos on the hike from the parking lot to my
professor's office.
