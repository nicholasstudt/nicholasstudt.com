I attempted to take pictures of the Lawrence fireworks again this year.
It worked slightly better than it had on previous occasions, but mostly
because I had a working tripod and had spent a couple minutes reading
the camera manual before going out. The hardest part about the entire
event was convincing Zooey that the tripod was not a footrest.

This was also the first year that we watched the fireworks from the
riverfront rather than the bridge. I have no doubt that we'll be down by
the riverfront again next year, unless Karen really does buy a kayak.
