![Tranquil :: Nikon D70 : 1/30s : f/16 : ISO 200](/media/2004/08/tranquility.jpg)

As Karen
[mentioned](http://karenvaughn.info/blog/article/smos/2004-08-16/colorado)
we spent the some time in Denver this past week. I took this picture
someplace in downtown Denver while Karen and I were wandering around on
Friday. There were several statues of children frozen in time, I don't
know that this is exactly tranquil so much as eerie.
