![Stream :: Nikon D70 : 1/200s : f/10 : ISO 200](/media/2004/08/stream.jpg)

This is the creek&mdash;though the signs kept referring to it as a
river&mdash;that runs through Estes Park in Colorado.

The only bad part was how poorly Karen and I felt. I never realized how
thick the air in Kansas was until I got into the mountains. After
walking around for an hour or so, I was exhausted. Karen didn't do much
better.
