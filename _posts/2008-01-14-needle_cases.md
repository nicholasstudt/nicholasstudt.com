![Needle Cases :: Nikon D70](/media/2008/01/needlecases.jpg)

I have finally managed to build a set of needle cases to hold my new
interchangeable needle set. I also built one in the same style to hold
my double pointed needles, and another bag for the incidental knitting
items. It only took me 3 weeks and about 10 different versions (with
varying degrees of success). Having to relearn how to use a sewing
machine didn't make the task any easier. I'm fairly happy with the
result, but I have a feeling I'll need to make a new pair since the
internal fabric is a little thin ([Another
View](/media/2008/01/needlecase.jpg)). The entire set of cases could use
some interfacing to help give them a little bit of backbone. This will
also give me the opportunity to find something manly, like pink
camouflage with little bunnies or some such.

Karen's latest pair of socks has been ripped out; the first one didn't
fit correctly. So much for trying a new pattern, new yarn, and a
different size needles. After I ripped the sock out, I picked up the
Lace Stole that has been stalled on the end table for the last couple of
months.
