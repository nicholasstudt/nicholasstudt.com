I just noticed that Unix Review fell off the face of the planet. After
consulting the great [Internet Oracle](http://google.com) I
found that Unix Review ceased publication in 2007. Their website now
redirects to [Dr. Dobb's](http://www.ddj.com), where I was
unable to find the two articles that I wrote for Unix Review in 2001.

I have posted both articles to my site for <del>vanity</del> historical
reasons. I haven't changed or updated the articles in anyway, so they
should be amusingly out of date at this point.

Enjoy the history.
