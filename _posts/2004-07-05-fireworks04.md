![Fireworks :: Nikon D70 : 7/2s : f/11 : ISO 200](/media/2004/07/fireworks.jpg)

Last night Karen and I went to the local fireworks display. There seems
to be some sort of evil weather god that attacks on the 4th each year in
Lawrence, this angry deity brings miserable humidity and mosquitoes. Oh
well.
