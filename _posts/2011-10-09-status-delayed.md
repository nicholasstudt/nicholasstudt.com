It seems I may have forgotten to mention that Karen and I went on a trip
to Washington, DC in May. I attended the Liferay East Coast Symposium
while Karen ran all over the city. The convention was held at [The
National Conference
Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Conference_Center)
which was made in the 1970s for Xerox and looks like an aztec temple in
the middle of a forest.
