![The Screamer :: Nikon D70](/media/2007/09/screamer.jpg)

Lawrence is home to a large crew of "interesting" locals, one of these
gentlemen is named The Screamer. He wanders about town flashing people
peace signs, on occasion he can be seen screaming at people in cars,
inanimate objects, or animals. The Screamer is so well known that
someone made this sticker likeness of him and placed it on the back of
one of the downtown buildings.
