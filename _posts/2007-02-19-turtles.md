![Turtles :: Nikon D70](/media/2007/02/turtles.jpg)

When I first found this [turtle
pattern](http://knitty.com/ISSUEwinter06/PATTsheldon.html) I thought it
would be a nice diversion from socks. These were actually fun to make,
though they did require a bit more seaming together than I generally
enjoy dealing with.

The blue one is Karen's, she named it Annabelle. The other two turtles
are headed out to Colorado as a gift.

In the background is Karen's giant shawl that she made at the start of
the winter.
