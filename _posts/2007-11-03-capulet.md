![Capulet :: Nikon D70](/media/2007/11/cape.jpg)

Monday night I cast on Karen's Gothic Leaf Stole ... again. I had
managed to get almost seven inches into the shawl, when I dropped a
stitch in a very unhappy way sometime last month. This left me with a
fairly large pile of tangled lace, and there wasn't much left to do
except to frog the entire project and start again. This is when I
learned why people place life lines in large lace projects.

Last night I finished the Michael Kors Cape (pictured above) for Karen.
It wasn't a particularly difficult project to knit. Unlike the last
project that I knit from a magazine, the pattern was almost entirely
error-free. The only problem was with the collar shaping, and it wasn't
an error so much as that I didn't like the way a purl stitch looked
when wrapped in a short row.

When we were at the crafts store looking for buttons, I picked up the
most amazing fabric from the waste bin. I found pirate and ghost
camouflage fabric to make into needle cases. These will be manly needle
cases, YAR!

Karen has also informed me that I will be making two new baby hats for
some inbound rugrats.
