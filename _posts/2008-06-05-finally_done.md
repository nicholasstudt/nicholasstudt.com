I have finally finished Karen's Gothic Leaf Stole. This was my first
lace project, and it only took me nine months to complete. In my
defense, I did have to start the project over since I dropped a stitch.

This past weekend Karen dyed some yarn that will be made into socks. The
process was much easier than either one of us expected it to be. The
yarn has dried and has been wound into skeins. All that is left to do
now is to make the socks.
