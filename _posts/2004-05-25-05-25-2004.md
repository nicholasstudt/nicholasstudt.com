![Big Fish :: Nikon D70 : 10/13s : f/4.5 : ISO 200](/media/2004/05/whale.jpg)

So this whale was in the Natural History Museum, and it was simply huge.
This is my big fish. The shutter speed for this photo was 10/13 of a
second, and I hand held it. The only modification from the original
in-camera image was the sizing for this site.
