![Corner :: Nikon D70 : 1/80s : f/22 : ISO 200](/media/2004/09/corner.jpg)

I go past this corner a couple times a day and every time I think it
looks a little bit like SOHO. But alas, it is only poor downtown
Lawrence.

Don't get too used to this daily posting, I may not be able to sustain
it unless I can find some more time to get out during the weekly grind.
