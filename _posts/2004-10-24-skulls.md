![Skulls :: Nikon D70 : 1/100s : f/18 : ISO 200](/media/2004/10/skulls.jpg)

These skulls have been brought to you by the happily kitschy people who
chase the customers about like flesh eating zombies. I don't think
I'll mention the store's name, since they are, in fact, evil.
Nonetheless, I'm submitting this to the "offset" theme at
[lensday.com](http://www.lensday.com).
