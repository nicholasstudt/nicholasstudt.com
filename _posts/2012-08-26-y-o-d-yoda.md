This past Saturday we made it down to Wichita to see the Star Wars
exhibit. It seemed like they had all of the props used in the original
trilogy and even some from the lesser set. It was a pretty cool, except
for being trapped in line for the "Millennium Falcon Experience" near a
noisy couple that had the most entertaining opinions about how video
games were the devils work.
