Yesterday Karen was looking for some magnets. During our search we came
across the Raccoon of Doom, he must have had to escape from Raccoon L.A.
or possibly Raccoon New York, which is obviously why he is missing an
eye. Just like our hero [Snake
Pliskin](http://www.alienspredator.com/fanfare/dreamcards/nonserious/SnakePliskin.html),
now if we can just get Raccoon a playing card...
