![Lousiana :: Nikon D70 : 1/40s : f/22 : ISO 200](/media/2004/09/lousiana.jpg)

I haven't had a chance to get out lately, with school in full swing. I
was starting to get concerned that I wouldn't even know which end of
the camera I was supposed to look through. This morning I grabbed the
camera and ran while Karen was getting ready.

You may also notice that this image is larger, I have been playing with
the layout a little bit so I can increase the size of the photos.
