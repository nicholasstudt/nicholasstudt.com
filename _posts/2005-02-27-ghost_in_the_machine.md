![Altair :: Nikon D70 : 1/12s : f/4.5 : ISO 200](/media/2005/02/altair8800.jpg)

This past January I altered my employment condition, now I'm working
for the University of Kansas Engineering Department. One of the best
things about the new location is the abundance of bizarre old hardware,
thankfully it's not in use.

Above is the main board from an Altair 8800, circa 1975.
