![Bronze Boy :: Nikon D70 : 1/40s : f/16 : ISO 200](/media/2004/08/bronze_boy.jpg)

This has to be my favorite picture from the trip to Colorado.

I don't know what it is with the people in Denver&mdash;they must
really like their children. So they bronze them. Guess that makes it
easy to know where they are all of the time...
