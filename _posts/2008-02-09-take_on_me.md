![Obama - Take on Obama :: Nikon D70](/media/2008/02/bama_aha.jpg)

This is another photo from the caucus earlier this week. Their shirts
reminded me of the music video for ["Take on Me"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_on_Me">).

I've read a bit in the local paper and heard stories from other people,
and to my surprise it appears that the caucus location we were at was
one of the most organized in the area. Today is the Republican caucus,
though with recent developments I doubt the turnout will be nearly as
high.
