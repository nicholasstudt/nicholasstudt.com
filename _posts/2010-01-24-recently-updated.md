Earlier this month I moved this domain and Karen's domain from a real
server to a VPS. So now everything should be endowed with cloudy
goodness, milk and honey.

As a result there are now updated version of
[KrKit](http://code.nicholasstudt.com/wiki/KrKit),
[WebMail](http://code.nicholasstudt.com/wiki/AlchemyWebMail), and the
[Blog](http://code.nicholasstudt.com/wiki/DjangoBlog).
