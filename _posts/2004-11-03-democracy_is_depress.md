![Democracy :: Nikon D70 : 1/60s : f/4.5 : Flash : ISO 200](/media/2004/11/democracy.jpg)

This was the first election that I have participated in since turning
eighteen, and it doesn't seem to have mattered. Living in a state where
62% of the population voted for Bush is depressing, but I am going to
take solace in the fact that I live in one of two counties that the
majority voted Democratic.

I took this photo when John Edwards came back through town, it was
peculiar to see one of these signs on the floor. Now it just seems
appropriate, a sign of defeat.

I've submitted this to lensday for the "neon dreams", as mine have just
been just been dashed.
