# {{ page.title }}

This is the collection of code that I have been involved in creating,
not including projects that I have been involved with at work which for
some reason they keep refusing for me to publish here. Go figure. 

The projects that are listed as retired are, well, retired. As such,
they are probably not going to see a lot of updates unless the wild hair
shows up and starts to go mad.

## [django-blog](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-blog)

This project is a yet another simple blog. There are many like it, but
this one is mine.

## [django-file-manager](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-file-manager)
	
This project allows users to manage files via the Django Admin area on
your site.

## [django-static-expander](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-static-expander)
	
This project allows static pages to be expanded and served with the
Django template system.

## [KrKit](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/KrKit) (retired)
	
This is a perl application framework that leans heavily towards
mod_perl. It contains simplified database connectivity, user
authorization and authentication, a template system, a help system,
inherited method handlers to simplify development, and much more.  The
[Gantry](http://www.usegantry.org/) framework was forked from this
project . If you really want to use a Perl framework go look at
[Gantry](http://www.usegantry.org/), they added a ton of new features.

## [Alchemy-Blog](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/Alchemy-Blog) (retired)
	
A simple mod_perl blog platform. 

## [Alchemy-FileManager](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/Alchemy-FileManager) (retired)

A mod_perl application that allows users to manage files on a remote
web server. 

## [Alchemy-FormBuilder](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/Alchemy-FormBuilder) (retired)

A mod_perl application that allows users to create web forms.

## [Alchemy-WebMail](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/Alchemy-WebMail) (retired)

Alchemy WebMail is a Web based mod_perl e-mail client. It relies on a
database for storing user application data and an IMAP server for
managing the user's e-mail. I wrote this years ago, it is still used by
the local ISP for their client facing web mail.

## [django-form-manager](https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-form-manager) (retired)
	
A Django application to create simple web forms. Don't use this, don't
download it, go use [Formunculous](http://formunculous.org/) instead.
