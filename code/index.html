<p>
	This is the collection of code that I have been involved in
	creating, not including projects that I have been involved with at
	work which for some reason they keep refusing for me to publish
	here. Go figure. 
</p>

<p>
	The projects that are listed as retired are, well, retired. As such,
	they are probably not going to see a lot of updates unless the wild
	hair shows up and starts to go mad.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-blog">django-blog</a></h3>
<p>
	This project is a yet another simple blog. There are many like it,
	but this one is mine.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-file-manager">django-file-manager</a></h3>
<p>
	This project allows users to manage files via the Django Admin area
	on your site.
</p>

	
<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-static-expander">django-static-expander</a></h3>

	Django template system.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/KrKit">KrKit</a> (retired)</h3>
<p>
	This is a perl application framework that leans heavily towards
	mod_perl. It contains simplified database connectivity, user
	authorization and authentication, a template system, a help system,
	inherited method handlers to simplify development, and much more.
	The <a href="http://www.usegantry.org/">Gantry</a> framework was
	forked from this project . If you really want to use a Perl
	framework go look at <a href="http://www.usegantry.org/">Gantry</a>,
	they added a ton of new features.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/Alchemy-Blog">Alchemy-Blog</a> (retired)</h3>

	A simple mod_perl blog platform. 
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/Alchemy-FileManager">Alchemy-FileManager</a> (retired)</h3>

	web server.

</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/Alchemy-WebMail">Alchemy-WebMail</a> (retired)</h3>
<p>
	Alchemy WebMail is a Web based mod_perl e-mail client. It relies on
	a database for storing user application data and an IMAP server for
	managing the user's e-mail. I wrote this years ago, it is still used
	by the local ISP for their client facing web mail.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nicholasstudt/django-form-manager">django-form-manager</a> (retired)</h3>
<p>
	A Django application to create simple web forms. Don't use this, don't
	download it, go use <a
	href="http://formunculous.org/">Formunculous</a> instead.
