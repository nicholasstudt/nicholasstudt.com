# {{ page.title }}

Nicholas spends his days wrecking havoc and sewing discord among school
children by facilitating standardized testing. By night, and weekends,
he spends his time nurturing a photography hobby that doesn't have the
kindness to die, knitting, writing code, and spending time with his
[beautiful wife](http://karenvaughn.info) and
[daughter](http://zooeyvaughn.com).

Several years ago Nicholas wrote a couple articles for *Unix Review*,
the magazine has been [swallowed by the
internet](/blog/2009-05-29/nuts).  One article on
[WINE](/blog/2001-01-15/wine) and another covering exactly [what makes a
license open source](/blog/2001-03-30/open-source-licensing).
